# FitFuel Support Case – Affirm Product Support Simulation

This GitHub repository supports a Notion-based case study demonstrating how a Product Support Specialist might handle a real-world merchant issue at Affirm. 

The project simulates:
An API key misfire
A webhook delivery failure

It includes:
Structured error logs
Initial merchant email
Tier 2 internal escalation note
Final resolution email

🔍 **Purpose of this Repository**

This repo is not meant to showcase code but rather:
How logs and internal documentation are structured
How a Support Specialist might access and interpret error data
How a clear communication and escalation process supports faster merchant resolution

🛠️ **Built as part of a mock portfolio for the Affirm Product Support Specialist I role.**
