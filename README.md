# Affirm Support Case Demo (Mock Project)

This project demonstrates my ability to support merchant partners in a technical SaaS environment, as described in the [Affirm Product Support Specialist I job posting](https://www.affirm.com/). It includes two common API-related issues and how I would triage and escalate them in a real-world setting.
