**Subject:** FitFuel Checkout Issue Resolved

Hi Jason,

Thanks for your patience. We've successfully reissued your API key and corrected the webhook configuration on your Shopify store. Affirm should now be appearing as expected at checkout.

Please clear your store cache and let us know if any issues persist.

Happy selling,
