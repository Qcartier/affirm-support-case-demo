**Subject:** Urgent: Affirm Integration Failure During Checkout

Hi Support,

Weâ€™ve received multiple customer complaints that Affirm is no longer showing up as a payment option on our Shopify store (FitFuel). When we checked the settings, it looked like the API credentials may have expired or misfired. 

We also noticed an order webhook error around the same time. Could someone help us get this fixed quickly? Our sales are being affected.

Thanks,  
Jason @ FitFuel
